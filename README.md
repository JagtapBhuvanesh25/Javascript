- Control flow: loops, conditionals, error handling  
- Higher-order functions, callbacks, `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.reduce()`  
- Closures, lexical scope, IIFEs  
- Prototypes, class syntax (`class` keyword), inheritance  
- Modules (ES6 import/export)  
- DOM selection, event listeners, manipulating the document  
- Browser memory model: stack vs heap, call stack, event loop  
- Best practices for clean, maintainable vanilla JavaScript
